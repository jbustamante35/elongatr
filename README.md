# elongatr
I don't know what this program will eventually do, but it's a funny name that has a potentially scientific purpose. Off the top of my head, I'm imagining this as an image analysis tool to measure and quantify the elongation of plant roots/shoots. Sort of like my [hypoquantyl](https://github.com/jbustamante35/hypoquantyl) program, but maybe to a lesser degree. 

So I wanted to be the first to claim it before anybody else uses it for like a tindr/grindr/etc-like app.

P.S.
If you're here because you actually want the name, just let me know and I'll probably delete this.
